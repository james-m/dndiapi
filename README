Python API for interfacing with the DnD Insider Compandium 
web service. The compendium is an online resource for 
DnD Insider subscribers to search the D&D 4e rules. 

The web service itself is described in this blog post from
many moons ago:

http://community.wizards.com/wotc_frazier/blog/2009/08/20/dd_insider_compendium_api__part_2

As this post suggests there are two pieces to the web service. The non-authenticated search
portion hit at this url endpoint: 
  
  http://www.wizards.com/dndinsider/compendium/compendiumsearch.asmx

The other piece is available only to dndinsider subscribers and requires authentication
to proceed. These use the ids returned from searching the search service above to
lookup detailed information on the display endpoint. For example:

  http://www.wizards.com/dndinsider/compendium/display.aspx?page=monster&id=920

The DNDIAPI uses the following python libraries:

* mechanize - browser emulator
* BeautilfulSoup - XML parsing
